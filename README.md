# Javascript-Conditionals

## I worked through the guide step by step as we were asked to do. 
## I watched the videos from Sm√°ri, did some research on Conditionals:
-- (If/Else Logical operators (!, ||, &&) 
-- Ternary operator)
-- Switch
--And break

## I also did researching by reading Jon Duckett's Javascript book and watching Youtube videos from Mosh's channel "Programming with Mosh".
